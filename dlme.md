## Metadata Comaprison
The images selected are both of The Sphinx with the Great Pyramid of Giza in the foreground. While selecting the images my criteria were to select images that looked similar but were taken using different artistic approaches. As such, the first image is an illustrated Postcard while the second is a stereoscopic photograph with a roughly similar viewpoint. Indeed, with a few minor adjustments and editing the two images may be made to look like illustrated and photographic versions of each other. The first image is titled _Pyramid and Sphinx_. This title is probably taken from the top left corner of the Image. The second image is titled _Ruins of the Temple, Sphinx, and Great Pyramid, Egypt_. 

Both images are provided by The American University in Cairo. The metadata provided for each image is consistent. This consistency is most likely a consequence of them being from the same libraries. However, there are some metadata items that are not provided for one of the images yet are provided for the other image. These metadata items include `description`, `medium`, and `publisher`. All three of these items are provided in the  `Captured`  image metadata but are not provided in the  `Illustrated`  image metadata. 

The metadata is fairly complete. At first glance, there are no glaring omissions. However, the metadata does not offer a `description` for the `Illustrated` image. Similarly, the `medium` and `publisher` of the `Illustrated` image are not provided either.  On making a search engine (`Google`) query for the missing metadata, similar images are obtained. No data specific to the image could be obtained because of the Generic title _Pyramid and Sphinx_. Searching the image by uploading it reveals two relevant results. The image has been used as a product image for the product [_Flower of Sakkara Oil Pure Egyptian Flower of Sakkara Oil, Clearing, Protection, Chakra Balancing from the Pyramid Texts of Saqqara Giza Egypt_](https://www.etsy.com/dk-en/listing/901044495/flower-of-sakkara-oil-pure-egyptian). 

The image has also been cited by another [_website_](http://home.xnet.com/~warinner/sphinx.html). This website titles the image _A postcard of the noseless Sphinx from 1910_. The website also claims that the postcard is from the  _"Service Informatique et Recherches en Archéologie"_ which is French for _“Computer and Archaeological Research Department”_. After this search “A postcard of the noseless Sphinx from 1910” is a suitable `title` for this image. Unfortunately, no metadata for the `medium` and `publisher` could be found. 

For the illustrated image combinations of the metadata don't work either because the metadata contains very general information. There are several images available which fit the same metadata which in essence is keywords such as Pyramid, Sphinx, Camels.
Although, it was not required a search engine query consisting solely of the `title` yielded a webpage of the American University of Cairo’s page for the subject image. An image search for the image also only yielded links to The American University of Cairo’s Rare Books and Special Collections Digital Library. 
Searching for the images using their `Identifiers` on the source website revealed additional metadata this has been compiled in the following table any metadata that was already available, or complete for both items has been excluded.

_None_ indicates that the subject metadata does not exist for the relevant item

Apart from the metadata omissions mentioned earlier, the metadata is relatively complete. However, some attributes may be added to aid discoverability. These may include an attribute such as `related items` which has hyperlinks to other items in the collection. Furthermore, metadata may include a metadata item called `audience` which may be used to indicate the intended audience for the item. Another metadata item may be `landmarks` seen in the object. Although, this has a slight overlap with location and description, a landmark `attribute` that applies unviersally without any spelling or language inconsistencies could be more useful. 


##  What is the importance of metadata to the discoverability of cultural objects in federated digital libraries?  How complete are they usually? What is the cost of metadata? How can we make it better? 

Metadata, literally means data about data. In Computer Science terminology, metadata is information about data that provides additional context, structure and meaning to the data, making it easier to find, organize and use. It has been around for a long time just by a different name – Cataloging. Cataloging records typically included information such as the author, title, publisher, publication date, and subjects. Similar principles apply to metadata today except that these principles are implemented and stored digitally, in digital libararies

Metadata is crucial to the discoverability of cultural objects in digital libraries, largely because it is metadata that enables computers to filter through millions of digital objects and find those that fit a user’s needs. Implementation of this capability becomes increasingly important in the case of federated digital libraries, as users must search through digital objects collected from multiple institutions and collections often with different metadata types. For example, in my two photographs the same image had a different metadata attribute that referred to the same thing. On one website “Topic” was used to refer to topics that overlapped with the photograph, whereas on another website “Subjects” was used to refer to subjects discussed in the photograph.

The importance of complete metadata may best be illustrated through consequences of incomplete metadata. For instance, if an object has very little metadata, should it be included in all searches or no searches? In the former scenario, if there are many such objects, this can have a significant impact on searches for all other objects in the digital library. This may lead to these objects showing up irrelevantly in all searches as their relevance cannot be assessed without complete metadata. In the latter scenario, this may lead to these objects not showing up at all, as there is very little metadata to match them to the search query. Therefore, metadata is as crucial to the existence of objects in a digital library as the objects themselves. Furthermore, complete and accurate metadata leads to better, more specific search results. It enables algorithms to find better and more relevant matches when searching through millions of objects. This helps researchers find cultural objects quickly and efficiently. Moreover, complete metadata facilitates finding matches between related objects. Algorithms can use tags in metadata to generate similarity scores that enable researchers to discover common threads among different digital objects. 

The cost of metadata largely depends on the techniques applied to collect it. If metadata is created manually by curators or professionals, it is time-consuming and expensive. However, if metadata is obtained from parent libraries of the digital items, its creation is both fast and cheap. Similarly, if algorithms are used to extract relatively simple metadata items metadata costs can be improved. 

Metadata can be improved through several means. The first step would be to agree on high-quality metadata standards. To collect metadata, personnel should be trained to comply to metadata standards and employ best practices. Furthermore, personnel should be provided with ongoing training and support to ensure that metadata standards are maintained. Furthermore, metadata quality may be improved through automating parts of the process. Algorithms can be used to collect certain metadata attributes, which may include file size, format, object archive date, image dimensions, and audio/video duration. After a subset of the metadata is complete, web-crawlers can be used to scrape the internet using search queries generated from the subset. Algorithms can then sift through the results and extract metadata. Additionally, keywords and tags may be extracted so that curators can sift through the results and add metadata manually.This adds to the efficiency of metadata creation. Morever, metadata may be improved through crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining information or input from a large group of people, especially online, typically in a relatively short time. This can be done by asking users to fill in metadata for objects that are missing metadata. Optical character recognition techniques can be leveraged to extract text from images and provide language detection as well. This can automate or at least aid filling of metadata items like subjects, keywords, and language.
